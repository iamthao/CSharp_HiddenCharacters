	Dear {{member_name}},
	<br />
	<br />
Liberty received your request for personal care services covered by BadgerCare Plus or Wisconsin 
	Medicaid. On {{unable_schedule_attemp_dates}} we tried calling you to schedule an in-person visit to assess your need for 
	services. We were not able to reach you. As a result, we are not able to process your 
	request. If you would still like to continue your request for personal care services, please contact us as soon as possible at 1-855-947-2742.
    <br />
    <br/>For more information about our assessment process for personal care services, go to <b><a href="http://www.wipcsia.com">www.wipcsia.com</a>.</b>
    <br />
    <br />Sincerely,
    <br />
    <br />
    <br/>
    <br />Liberty Healthcare Corporation
