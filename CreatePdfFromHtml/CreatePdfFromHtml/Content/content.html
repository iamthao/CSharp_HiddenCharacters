    <br />
    Dear {{member_name}},
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
        Thank you for submitting an eligibility application for developmental disability (DD) services, as defined in Idaho Code &sect; 66-402(5). At this time, the
        Department is unable to process your application for DD services because <b>
            you did not provide us with enough information showing that you qualify for
            DD services.
        </b> The following applies to our inability to process your application:
    </p>
    <p>
        <table style="width:100%;padding-left:20px;">
            <tr>
                <td style="width:20px" valign="top"><input type="checkbox"></td>
                <td style="padding-left:10px;" valign="top">We did not receive information from you showing that your disability began before the age of twenty-two (22) years of age (IDAPA 16.03.10.501).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td style="width:20px;padding-top:10px;" valign="top"><input type="checkbox"></td>
                <td style="padding-left:10px;padding-top:10px;" valign="top">
                    We did not receive information from you showing that your disability is attributable to an impairment such as intellectual disability, cerebral
                    palsy, epilepsy, autism, or other condition found to be closely related to or similar to one of these impairments that requires similar treatment or services, or is attributable
                    to dyslexia resulting from such impairments (IDAPA 16.03.10.501).

                    You must take certain tests to determine whether you have a developmental disability and those tests must reflect your current functional status.  Tests
                    that have been done in the past, but not within the last year, must be verified by an appropriate professional to reflect your current functional status.  (IDAPA 16.03.10.503) The following
                    test(s) were performed in the past but not within the last year and were not verified by a professional:

                    If you want the Department to consider additional information or documents with your application, you have thirty (30) days from the date of this
